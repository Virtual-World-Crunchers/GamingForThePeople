# Lacuna v1

**Lacuna v1** is a project that is attempting to address toxicity in competitive online team-based games, particularly on solo players that play games like League of Legends. It is our hope that we can encourage a more friendlier gaming community through a means of immediate intervention when toxic behaviour occurs during gameplay.


## Features included:
* Slow Mode Chat
* Toxicity Notification
* Individual Muting


## Getting Started
The following instructions will help you to get a copy  of the game and run it locally.

### Prerequisites 
Before cloning the repo from GitHub, make sure the Git LFS (Large File Storage) has been installed.  You can read about the installation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage). Moreover, get Unreal Engine installed as well to open up the game.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo to local
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Virtual-World-Crunchers/GamingForThePeople.git
```

2. Open the project file <br>

Either:


* Open the application file (Currently for Windows) <br>
```shell
.../Lacuna_V1/WindowsNoEditor/ShooterGame.exe
```

OR

* Use Unreal Engine to open the project <br>
```shell
.../VWC-Project/Prototype1/Prototype1.uproject
```
* And launch the game by clicking on _"Launch"_ in the top menu bar


## Usage
### Slow Mode Chat:
Users can choose whether they want to enable message delay when they are receiving toxic messages with "ALT + 1" keybind. A message will pop up, which will notify the players that they have already enabled the slow chat mode if they choose yes. The slow chat feature can also be toggled on by using "ALT + 1" command to disable it as the user needs. There will be no changes if the user do not want to turn on this function.

### Toxicity Notification
If suspicious toxic messages detect in the chat. A pop up window will allows user to determine whether they think the chat log is toxic and mute the players they think is toxic.
