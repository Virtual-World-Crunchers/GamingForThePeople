# Gaming For the People

Gaming For the People is a project that is attempting to address toxicity in competitive online team-based games, particularly on solo players that play games like League of Legends. It is our hope that we can encourage a more friendlier gaming community through a means of immediate intervention when toxic behaviour occurs during gameplay.
