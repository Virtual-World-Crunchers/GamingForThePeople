# Gaming For the People

Gaming For the People is a project that is attempting to address toxicity in competitive online team-based games, particularly on solo players that play games like League of Legends. It is our hope that we can encourage a more friendlier gaming community through a means of immediate intervention when toxic behaviour occurs during gameplay.

When uploading and downloading the Unity project, you may get an error like "Filename too long". You can fix this error by entering this command in the command line in the folder you're saving the project to in Git bash (or something similar with git installed): 
$ git config --global core.longpaths true

Also, to prevent further errors with committing the Unity files, please ensure the Unity editor is closed before you commit until the repository can be configured to exclude certain folders and files.
