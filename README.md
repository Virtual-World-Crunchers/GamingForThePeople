# Lacuna v1

**Lacuna v1** is a project that is attempting to address toxicity in competitive online team-based games, particularly on solo players that play games like League of Legends. It is our hope that we can encourage a more friendlier gaming community through a means of immediate intervention when toxic behaviour occurs during gameplay.

## Feature
* Slow chat mode
* Warning Tips
* Discouraging toxicity in game

## Getting Started
The following instructions will help you to get a copy  of the game and run it locally.

### Prerequisites 
Before cloning the repo from GitHub, make sure the Git LFS (Large File Storage) has been installed.  You can read about the installation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage). Moreover, get Unreal Engine installed as well to open up the game.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Virtual-World-Crunchers/GamingForThePeople.git
```

## Usage
Users can choose whether they want to enable message delay or not when they are receiving toxic messages. A notification will pop up, which will notify the players that they have already enabled the slow chat mode if they choose yes. There will be no changes if the user do not want to turn on this function.
